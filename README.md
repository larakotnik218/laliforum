 Php project
 
 Forum is a simple PHP project.

REGISTRATION / LOGIN
 It allows registration and login and login with Facebook or Google.

PROFILE EDITING
A user who is not logged in with Google or Facebook can edit their profile or change their profile picture. If the image is not set initially, your profile picture sets to default.

ADDING RECORDS
Any user who is logged in can add a new record. He writes the title, the content - he can also format the content, with  CK-editor which has been added, and in the end, he chooses the topic.

SEARCH
The site also contains a search bar to search for topics.

COMMENTS
 records can be commented by any logged-in user.

ADMINISTRATOR
the administrator can delete records, add topics and set a user who is serious, exemplary, and respectful for a verified forum user.

PAGE
The forum website is fully responsive. Modals are used to enter data (login, register, record, add a topic, ..). For responsive design, I used  UK kit.
